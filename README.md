# GameCoordinator

AfterBloom MC's solution to managing Minigames. The coordinator handles:

* Managing which games are active
* Player MatchMaking
* Provisioning Backup servers
* Custom Events triggered by admins
* and more to come soon!

The system uses Plugin messaging to talk to the Proxy and each Minigame's server

Note: If you are not an AfterBloom dev Please don't open issues here! Use the bug reports system in discord (.gg/afterbloom)
